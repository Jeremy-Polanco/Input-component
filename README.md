Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo? is at https://reusable-input-component.netlify.app
- What was your experience?  very straight foward project to get comfortable with the syntax of the framework used.
- What have you learned/improved? I improved my knowledge about inputs, label, and textarea, and how to style them at will.
- Your wisdom? If you want to change the style of the label while is on hover, you have to place it below the input and add .("the-input-class"):hover + "("the label class")" and then add the desired styles.
